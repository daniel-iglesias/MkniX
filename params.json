{"name":"MkniX","tagline":"Nonlinear thermo-mechanical multibody systems simulation using FEM and meshfree methods","body":"## Overview\r\nMkniX is a code design for the simulation of nonlinear flexible multibody systems, including thermal effects. It is organised as a library but, as it already has all necesary I/O functions, building a binary is trivial. Several examples of applications using the MkniX library are provided in the `tests/` folder.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n## Building and testing\r\nSee README.md for a description of requirements and procedure for building the MkniX library and using it for creating binary executables.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nMkniX library is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as\r\npublished by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the\r\nLicense, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nTests are distributed under GPL version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
